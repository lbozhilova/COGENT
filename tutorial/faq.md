# Frequently asked questions

This page attempts to address some implementation and use case questions. For an overview of COGENTâ€™s functionality and intended use, we strongly recommend reading the [tutorial](https://lbozhilova.github.io/COGENT/tutorial/tutorial.html) first. 

## How do I install and load COGENT?

COGENT can be installed directly from R, using the `devtools` package. You can then load COGENT like any other R package. 
```
# Install
require("devtools")
install_github("lbozhilova/COGENT")
# Load
require("COGENT")
```

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [tutorial](https://lbozhilova.github.io/COGENT/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## What version of R do I need?

COGENT is compatible with R v.3.6.2 and above. However, we recommend always using the most recent version of R, and regularly updating your packages.

## Does COGENT work on all operating systems?

COGENT has been tested on Windows, MacOS and Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora). You can access all of its functionality on MacOS and Linux. However, Windows does not support forking, and so the paralellised functions of COGENT cannot be used to improve your computation speed on Windows. We therefore recommend that MacOS or Linux is used for large datasets and heavy computation.

## What split size (or equivalently `propShared`) should I use when running COGENT?

A COGENT iteration works by randomly splitting your gene expression samples in two subsets, and constructing a network from each subset. These subsets can overlap, and the overlap is controlled by the `propShared` parameter (see `?cogentSingle` for details).

The default value `propShared=0` will always create disjoint subsets. If you have relatively few samples in your data (say less than 60), we recommend introducing a set overlap. The best level of overlap will depend on your data, but we recommend setting `propShared=0.25` or `propShared=0.5` in the first instance.
 
To illustrate, with 60 samples and `propShared=0`, COGENT will generate two subsets of 30 samples each, and those subset will be entirely disjoint. With `propShared=0.5`, COGENT will generate two subsets of 45 samples each. Of these, 30 will be shared, and 15 will be unique to each subset.

## How many COGENT iterations (`repCount`) should I run?

Multiple independent iterations of COGENT are required to provide the most robust results. The number of iterations are controlled by the `repCount` parameter (see `?cogentLinear` for details).

We generally recommend using COGENT with the default value of `repCount=100` iterations. Please note that `cogentParallel` can be used to reduce the computational time if needed.

## When should I be using density correction (`getEdgeSimilarityCorrected`)?

Density correction (aka density adjustment) is introduced in the  `getEdgeSimilarityCorrected()` function. It can be used to compare network construction methods which result in networks of significantly different density.

You should always use density correction if you are trying to find an optimal threshold for network construction, i.e. if you are trying to determine score cut-off using COGENT. The [tutorial](https://lbozhilova.github.io/COGENT/tutorial/tutorial.html) contains a worked example of how this can be done.

You should also use density correction when comparing two network construction methods which are not guaranteed to result in networks of similar density.

You do not need to use density correction if you are using node metric consistency as your primary consistency measure, provided your node metric of choice is density-independent.

You should not use density correction on methods resulting in signed and/or weighted networks.

## Which density correction should I use?

There are two density correction methods available through the `type` parameter of the `getEdgeSimilarityCorrected()` function. These are the semi-random correction (`type="expected"`) and the fully-random correction (`type=random`). See the [Supplementary Information](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.163535v1.supplementary-material) of our paper for details on how these are computed.

By default, the semi-random correction is carried out. This is significantly faster than the fully-random correction, and we recommend using it.

## I am interested in constructing signed, possibly weighted networks. Can I still use COGENT?

COGENT is designed to be used for unsigned networks. In particular, edge similarity calculated using `getEdgeSimilarity()` and `getEdgeSimilarityCorrected()` will be entirely non-informative when calculated for signed networks.

Nevertheless, there are several ways of using COGENT for signed networks.

You can convert signed networks to unsigned by rescaling or using quantiles. The `buildPearson()` function in the [tutorial](https://lbozhilova.github.io/COGENT/tutorial/tutorial.html) illustrates one possible way of doing this - Pearson correlation coefficients can be negative, but if their quantiles are used instead, thresholding and weighted comparisons can be readily performed.

You can also use node metric consistency, either through the main COGENT functions, or through `getNodeSimilarity()`, to evaluate signed network construction methods. Note that in this case, your node metric of choice should result in non-negative values. This can be achieved via rescaling, for example.
